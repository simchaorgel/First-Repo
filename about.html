        <h2>Qualifications and Training</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I trained at Tavistock Relationships, an internationally renowned provider of relationship counselling,
            as a couple and individual psychodynamic psychotherapist. I obtained a clinical qualification in Couple and
            Individual Psychotherapy, accredited by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).
            I also hold an MA in Couple and Individual Psychotherapy from the University of East London.
            <br><br>
            I work with couples and individuals and have a special area of interest in how we behave and communicate
            in relationships. Psychodynamic therapy is about working with the unconscious and that would include thinking
            about childhood experiences, relationships with parental figures, previous couple relationships and role models.
            We can explore how these have affected a current relationship or how these impact challenges around staying in a
            relationship. 
            <br><br>
            I also hold a QTS teaching qualification and my work with children has given me a broad understanding of child
            development. In my work with couples I have found this useful around parenting challenges and the dynamic between
            the partners in the couple when they don't agree over parenting decisions. 
            <br><br>
            I have previously worked as a visiting clinician at Tavistock Relationships and I attend regular supervision and
            CPD events to discuss my work and enhance my training and experience with clients.
            <br><br>
            I work within the codes of ethics of my member organisations and comply with the current data protection
            regulations, which maintain confidentiality and ensure data is not passed on to any third party without
            your permission.
            <br><br>
            I am a graduate member of TRAPC (Tavistock Relationships Association for Psychotherapists and Counsellors) and
            a registered member of the BACP (British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapy). I am fully insured
            for my work.
