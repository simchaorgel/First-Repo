            <h2>Initial Consultation</h2>
            Once we agree to meet, I will invite you to an initial consultation. This is an opportunity for you to
            explain what has brought you to therapy and to ask any questions you may have. It is also a chance for me
            to find out more about you, your (and your partner's) history and any other relevant information, so we can get
            an idea if we may be a good fit as client(s) - therapist. The initial consultation will take 50 minutes and
            sometimes a secondary session is advised. Following this, we can decide together if ongoing therapy with
            me is the right choice for you. (<a href="#fees">See Fees</a>)

            <h2>Ongoing Sessions</h2>
            If we decide to proceed, we will meet weekly at the same time, also for 50 minute sessions, and this time
            slot will be held for you. The weekly sessions will be different from the initial consultation as they are
            more open-ended and are led by you. We will work on whatever issues you bring every week, and the sessions can
            vary in content. One week you may have had a row or disagreement which you are keen to bring, while another
            time you may choose to discuss a more long-standing issue. I will take your cues and hopefully help you
            process your thoughts and feelings in a way that makes sense.
            <br><br>
            My approach is psychodynamic and as such, a particular focus of the work is to help you link different aspects
            of your experiences, both inside and outside of relationships.  In the long run, this will hopefully help you
            gain awareness of the dynamics in your relationships, learn about any difficult triggers and their meanings
            and enhance your understanding of what is going on, giving you the tools to create the changes you are hoping for.

            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>   
            Everything you bring to our sessions will be treated as confidential, unless I feel someone is at risk of
            imminent harm. Even then, I will always try to work with you and discuss what is going on.

            <h2>Location</h2>
            I currently see people face to face from <a href="location.html">my clinic</a> in Camden/Kentish Town and also
            work remotely via Zoom.
            Sessions are never recorded and are treated as confidential. I will send you a secure link that only I have
            access to.

            <h2>Availability</h2>
            I currently have limited daytime slots available. I have no evening or weekend availability at the moment.
            <br>
            I offer a short complimentary phone call to answer any questions and discuss scheduling.

            <h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>
            The cost of an initial consultation for couple sessions is £130.
            <br>
            The cost of an initial consultation for individual sessions is £110.
            <br>
            We will discuss and agree fees, dates and timings for weekly sessions at the initial consultation.
